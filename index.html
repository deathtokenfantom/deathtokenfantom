        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Who are we? We are regular people, a large group aiming for a better future. Some members are anonymous, while others are not. What is this token? DEATH is a simple ERC-20 token on the Fantom Network. As a collective, we have decided to launch a single token rather than multiple tokens for different projects. What can you expect? Nothing. We do not promise anything. However, you can track wallets, and maybe we might update as we develop and launch; itâ€™s all about turning ideas into reality. Who owns this token? No one. The owner function was renounced after making adjustments. What are the airdropped wallets? As mentioned before, we are a large group, and we all have ideas that we want to realize. Wallets are not multisig; they are wallets with shared private keys. Each different team has a different amount of tokens and a different number of private key holders.</p>
